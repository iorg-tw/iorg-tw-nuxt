Taiwan’s information environment is </span><span>affected</span><span class=\"c0\"> by few privately-owned web platforms and is crowded with fragmented information. The public is affected by one’s self and partisan identity, depends on opinion leaders, lacks methods to verify the quality and evaluate the credibility of information. Development of good public discourse is therefore limited.</span></h3><h3 class=\"c11 c17 c36\" id=\"h.6oxpnxikcv7f\"></h3><p class=\"c11\"><span class=\"c6\">Taiwan’s information environment is free and diverse. The popularization of radio, television, and internet communication has enabled free sharing of information and new connections. Anyone can have a voice and information is more accessible than ever, including information that conforms to one’s identity but not necessarily trustworthy.</span></p><p class=\"c11\"><span class=\"c6\">Nowadays, access to information and other various forms of interaction are highly concentrated on a handful of privately-owned, profit-driven web platforms. These platforms control visibility of information through targeted recommendation algorithms powered by personal information of their users and cases of abuse have occurred. On these platforms, anonymity is allowed, bringing both freedom and problems. Interviews show that mainstream web platforms are not designed and not suited for public discourse. Existing platform mechanisms could also obstruct good public discourse.</span></p><p class=\"c11\"><span class=\"c6\">While the internet information environment thrives, information fragmentation follows, and the environment is crowded with simplified information. At the same time, the public is affected by one’s self and partisan identity, depends on opinion leaders, internet influencers, and other authorities with varying degrees of qualifications, lacks publicly credible information quality verification mechanisms, and feasible information credibility evaluation methods. These circumstances limit the development of good public discourse.</span></p><h3 class=\"c11 c17\" id=\"h.6d72a0x6hl1v\"><span class=\"c0\">2. Public discourse is becoming more difficult and participation in public discourse is diminishing across sectors of Taiwan’s society, in particular public online discussions where aggression and emotion is common while interaction remains limited to affirming identity and position rather than presenting facts and debating opinions.</span></h3><p class=\"c11\"><span class=\"c6\">Public discourse is becoming more difficult in recent years, in particular discussions on public web platforms, interviews show.</span></p><p class=\"c11\"><span>Aggressive, emotional content on various web platforms is a common experience in our daily lives. In Taiwan, public discourse is easily reduced into binary opposition when it is related to political parties or elections, partisan or self identity often take precedence over, even replacing substantive discussions. Web platforms, in encouraging the gathering of users with similar preferences and positions, could have amplified such an effect. Interviews show that interactions on various web platforms often pertain to verifying personal identity, fortifying position, and responding to emotion, rather than presenting facts and debating opinions. Under circumstances of clear confrontation, politicians or </span><span>policy groups</span><span class=\"c6\"> tend to be unable to avoid declaring their policy position. When such a position differs from the mainstream, it is becoming more common that they suffer criticism from supporters who are more extreme, in turn making a group with a similar position more homogeneous and leaning towards extreme.</span></p><p class=\"c11\"><span>Participation in public discourse is diminishing across sectors of Taiwan’s society and public attitude towards participation is turning conservative, apathetic, and tiresome. Some interviews show a lower passion towards political participation while others show the public losing patience towards longform information. LGBTQ and ally communities show fatigue towards public participation after frequent mobilization in support of same-sex marriage legalization. In recent years, students show reluctance towards making judgment and declaring positions on policy issues due to lack of political efficacy from the lowering levels of confrontation in social movement, abundance in alternative information from popular audio-video entertainment social platforms, and school curriculums encouraging diverse information consumption and discouraging political discussions on campus. Rising levels of difficulty are causing </span><span>civil society groups</span><span class=\"c6\"> to avoid online engagement and instead host offline closed-door stakeholder meetings for policy advocacy. Furthermore, debates in city councils are decreasing, said city councilors during interviews, while local politicians tend to follow party lines and avoid declaring their own positions on policy issues when facing local constituencies. These circumstances reduce participation and inclusivity in public discourse, in turn diminish the legitimacy of democratic processes.</span></p><h3 class=\"c11 c17\" id=\"h.3thlqntqcln5\"><span class=\"c0\">3. Information manipulation persists, maintains high volume, and degrades the foundation of trust for public discourse in Taiwan. Sources are both domestic and foreign while forms encompass more than falsehood and include manipulative behaviors and environmental mechanisms.</span></h3><p class=\"c11\"><span class=\"c6\">Information manipulation has persisted and maintained a high volume in Taiwan’s information environment, interviews show. Negative state of public discourse during election campaigns is now the new norm, said civil society organizers during interviews. Foreign and domestic, various forms of information manipulation is crowding Taiwan’s information environment.</span></p><p class=\"c11\"><span>After the 2018 elections, many political parties and politicians undertook significant effort in organizing online communities, inspired by specific candidates during the 2018 elections, said political workers during interviews. Strategies were formulated to target various </span><span>social groups</span><span class=\"c6\"> in order to increase and improve overall volume and image of the person or party. During the 2020 elections, multiple government agencies used large amounts of simplified infographics and memes to promote government performance, which could have contained information manipulation, interviews show.</span></p><p class=\"c11\"><span class=\"c6\">Taiwan’s news media further overflows the information environment with sensational, low-quality content due to its profit-driven nature, lack of fact-checking mechanism and culture, and existing negligence to truthfulness, rigor, and independence of its reporting. Excessive and repetitive reporting of specific candidates during the 2018 elections indirectly impacted election results, interviews show. Traditional media outlets, in transitioning to web platforms, maintain influence over its audience while content becomes more sensational and more frequently contains information manipulation. Local media organizations, in various symbiotic relations with local governments, representatives, and private corporations, further compromise the independence and trustworthiness of the news.</span></p><p class=\"c11\"><span>Online anonymous accounts spread </span><span>aggressive</span><span class=\"c6\"> content regardless of political stance. Anonymous extreme content attracts attention, amplifies confrontation, and impairs public discourse while being unaccountable. Some moderators of anonymous Facebook Pages publish content knowing that it could contain information manipulation. Additionally, low-quality articles from unverifiable sources are published by content farms and then frequently shared by clusters of anonymous Facebook Pages. Fixed combinations of content farms and Facebook Pages acting recurrently in coordinated fashion can artificially increase volume of specific topics on web platforms.</span></p><p class=\"c11\"><span class=\"c6\">Political parties, politicians, news media, and other content producers often adjust their production and marketing strategies conforming to platform mechanisms and audience preferences, prioritizing clicks and other indicators for user interaction. This behavior could easily create information manipulation.</span></p><p class=\"c11\"><span class=\"c6\">Foreign information manipulation continues to propagate in Taiwan’s information environment. PRC state agencies and CCP media outlets spread information manipulation during elections and other important events in Taiwan, reinforcing negative perceptions of Taiwan’s democratic governance and international democratic alliance. Specific personalities and media outlets in Taiwan amplify CCP content while CCP also amplify content from specific Taiwanese media, celebrities, “island netizens (岛内网民),” anonymous Facebook Pages, and hijacked accounts, in order to expand its sphere of influence. Additionally, interviews show conservative church groups in the US provided financial support to for anti-LGBTQ groups in Taiwan to purchase TV ads during the 2018 referendums.</span></p><p class=\"c11\"><span>Information manipulation evolves continuously and comes in various forms and degrees of severity. Not only falsehood, problematic source, content, inference, as well as manipulative behaviors and environmental mechanisms, are degrading the foundation of trust essential for </span><span>reasonable</span><span class=\"c6\"> public discourse.</span></p><div class=\"gdoc-table-container\"><div class=\"table\"><table class=\"c24\"><tbody><tr class=\"c18\"><th class=\"w-8\"

Information manipulation affects understanding of public affairs, obstructs reasonable public discourse, intensifies confrontation and polarization, and indirectly affects decision-making of politicians and political parties, elections and referendum results.</span></h3><p class=\"c11\"><span class=\"c6\">Information manipulation continues to spread in Taiwan’s information environment, affecting its audience in terms of understanding of public affairs. Interviews show negative social impact due to the continued existence of information manipulation, including the impediment of the spread of trustworthy information, obstruction of reasonable public discourse, and intensification of confrontation and polarization.</span></p><p class=\"c11\"><span class=\"c6\">Additionally, domestic and foreign information manipulation affects decision-making of politicians and political parties in creating dilemmas in public communications, bias in formulating policies based on narrow or extreme opinions, and ineffectiveness in reflecting the diversity of one’s supporters.</span></p><h3 class=\"c11 c17\" id=\"h.ij32twlyhpj8\"><span class=\"c0\">5. Sectors of Taiwan’s society encounter various difficulties in responses and are unable to effectively reduce information manipulation and improve public discourse.</span></h3><p class=\"c11\"><span class=\"c6\">Polls show that a majority of people in Taiwan expect proactive government actions in reducing information manipulation. However, interviews show such actions have achieved limited results. Some interview participants raised concerns on government regulation on information manipulation as infringement of freedom of expression. Others warned of the possibility of government action causing backlash, creating an impression of government abuse of power, that the punishment is disproportionate or driven by corrupt pursuit of personal or partisan gain. Additionally, political workers have said during interviews that there is a lack of wide acceptance amongst lawmakers towards legislative responses to information manipulation, resulting in a lack of progress at the legislature.</span></p><p class=\"c11\"><span class=\"c6\">Fact-checking is an integral part of the infrastructure in reducing information manipulation. However, fact-checkers face various difficulties. While the concept of fact-checking is nowadays widely known, the credibility of fact-checking reports and organizations is not yet fully established. The contemporary multiplicity in informational channels and formats increases the cost and creates predicaments for fact-checking, said fact-checkers during interviews. Additionally, interviews also show that fact-checking cannot resolve every kind of information manipulation.</span></p><p class=\"c11\"><span class=\"c6\">Information literacy is a key capacity in evaluating credibility of various information and participating in public discourse. However, information literacy education lacks support in schools. Before the current “108” Curriculum Guidelines, related subjects were almost absent in the 12 years of national basic education between age 6 and 18. Out of the 3-year high school education, 1 class – approximately 1 hour – was allotted to media and public opinion formation, said educators during interviews. It has been 3 years up to August 2022 since the current Curriculum Guidelines came into effect in September 2019. Under the current Guidelines, media and information literacy is amongst the 9 core competencies, and must be incorporated into classes in each discipline. However, difficulties in advancing information literacy education persists due to lack of performance verification from authorities, lack of motivation for teachers and schools, lack of training, professional knowledge, and connections with experienced civil society groups for motivated teachers, and common student mentality that prioritize exams, decouples school education and everyday lives, and the habit of no politics on campus.</span></p><div class=\"separator\"></div><div class=\"stickers\"></div><h2 class=\"c11 c17\" id=\"section-6\"><span class=\"c27\">B.3 Opportunities</span></h2><h3 class=\"c11 c17\" id=\"h.34fqmyowu467\"><span class=\"c0\">1. Public and government awareness of information manipulation is largely in place</span></h3><p class=\"c11\"><span class=\"c6\">A majority of the people and various government agencies in Taiwan are already aware of and alerted by information manipulation, interviews show.</span></p><p class=\"c11\"><span>For the people, internet</span><span class=\"c6\"> rumors have existed for a long time. COVID-19-related information manipulation circulating since the start of the pandemic from Wuhan concerns personal well-being and further increased public awareness on the subject. Some interview participants said that falsehood is now part of popular culture while others mentioned the diminished effectiveness of politicians persuading voters using simplified slogans due to increased awareness.</span></p><p class=\"c11\"><span class=\"c6\">For the government, despite actions resulting in varying effects, the central government has set up principles and guidelines and proposed new laws and amendments in response to information manipulation. Meanwhile, both central and local authorities have put in place services providing timely clarification to the public. These actions can be interpreted as government awareness and institutionalized response to information manipulation. </span></p><h3 class=\"c11 c17\" id=\"h.ggsxf96o4rxs\"><span class=\"c0\">2. Some politicians and political staffers are aware of the negative effect of their behavior obstructing public discourse and have yet to reform; political figures advanced public discourse through open government mechanisms that were discontinued and not yet replicated elsewhere</span></h3><p class=\"c11\"><span class=\"c6\">Politicians have said during interviews that it is unavoidable to cater to user preferences when engaging with communities online. In the pursuit of exposure, adjustments to content production and management strategies can be made to the effect which they know could bring about information manipulation. Political staffers have also shared their experiences participating in online public discourse, in admission that political stance and personal identity of other users would affect whether they consider these opinions.</span></p><p class=\"c11\"><span class=\"c6\">Interview participants have shared and recognized their positive experiences participating in a shadow city council. The council, being an open government mechanism created and fully-participated by the mayor, created incentives for participants to express their opinions on public policies, in turn facilitated public discourse in their own communities. However, interview participants have also said that the council was discontinued by the next administration, and that they have not observed any other similar example henceforth.</span></p><h3 class=\"c11 c17\" id=\"h.l5wv01qaq0e0\"><span class=\"c0\">3. Fact-checking could help to reduce information manipulation in some situations while not in others; Ukrainian journalists and Hongkong pro-democracy activists continue to disseminate fact-based information and maintain trust under extreme circumstances</span></h3><p class=\"c11\"><span class=\"c6\">Fact-checking could help to reduce information manipulation on public platforms. Past cases show reduced amounts of related information manipulation after the publication of fact-checking results on public platforms. Alternatively, false information reoccurs on closed platforms regardless of fact-checking. Additionally, research shows that fact-checking can calibrate misunderstandings on public platforms, at the same time reinforce existing beliefs on closed platforms and be counterproductive to building information literacy.</span></p><p class=\"c11\"><span class=\"c6\">In Taiwan, third-party fact-checking has been in operation in recent years and is now widely known. Interview participants have said that fact-checking reports started to appear in chat groups amongst family and friends and that fact-checking related to everyday life is the most accepted. Multiple public social platforms have preliminarily integrated fact-checking while third-party tools are still required on closed platforms, generating friction for the platform users.</span></p><p class=\"c11\"><span class=\"c6\">Outside of Taiwan, fact-checking is being practiced by citizens and journalists confronted with greater challenges. In the face of state violence, Hongkong pro-democracy activists insist on spreading truthful information and avoiding unverified information that intensifies emotion. During the Russian invasion, Ukrainian news media continues to carefully fact-check government information, for falsehoods threaten safety and the lives of their fellow citizens.</span></p><h3 class=\"c11 c17\" id=\"h.71u9mp2uz5j2\"><span class=\"c0\">4. Physical discussions are conducive to good public discourse and relatively feasible, working cases exist while lacking space, resources, methods, capabilities, incentives, and habit.</span></h3><p class=\"c11\"><span class=\"c6\">Physical discussions, compared to online public discussions, are relatively feasible and have a higher chance of becoming constructive, interviews show. Public discourse in physical space holds advantages over that in cyberspace. Face-to-face conversations have the benefit of physical presence through which the source of information can be identified, said some interview participants, while others pointed out that people tend to be more civil in face-to-face situations, causing less confrontation when in disagreement. Examples of physical discussions conducive to good public discourse, provided by local community organizers, include public policy book clubs hosted for local high school students and community spaces collectively maintained by the neighborhoods. </span></p><p class=\"c11\"><span>COVID-19 pandemic has forced citizens to gather online and the effectiveness of discussion suffered greatly, said </span><span>policy activists</span><span class=\"c6\"> during interviews, stressing the necessity of physical discussions, which is a focal point of their current work. Local community organizers also stated that the promotion of local public policy issues must return to the building of local communities and the maintenance of physical spaces.</span></p><p class=\"c11\"><span class=\"c6\">Nevertheless, public discourse in physical space has its challenges. Physical discussions require space and other resources, as well as methodologies and capabilities for the participants. As some interview participants pointed out, lack of these elements and epidemic prevention measures would hinder the emergence of conversations. Additionally, physical discussions often attract people with similar information sources or political stances while having difficulties engaging with people who hold different opinions.</span></p><p class=\"c11\"><span class=\"c6\">According to some policy activists during interviews, public discourse in physical space can energize extensive discussions on policy issues among local communities and facilitate systematic changes in local governance. Regardless of the success of one social movement, good public discourse leaves a legacy of experience with the civil society participants as well as positive changes in institutions.</span></p><p class=\"c11\"><span class=\"c6\">Keys in promoting public discourse in physical space are open spaces, capabilities, incentives, and habit of participation. Moreover, proper utilization of public space could help in engaging people who hold different opinions, said interview participants. Lennon Walls appearing frequently in the democracy movements in Hongkong are good examples.</span></p><h3 class=\"c11 c17\" id=\"h.507t1waquca8\"><span class=\"c0\">5. Start from education: Civil society action on reducing information manipulation and improving public discourse with information literacy education has achieved initial results. Expansion of teachers training and institutional support are in need.</span></h3><p class=\"c11\"><span class=\"c6\">Personal capacity of information literacy, which is the ability to discern various information manipulation, is the most essential and fundamental method in reducing information manipulation, interviews show. Furthermore, information literacy can and must be improved through deliberate practices.</span></p><p class=\"c11\"><span class=\"c6\">Under the current Curriculum Guidelines, teachers are afforded more flexibility to expand public space on campus while students have higher incentives to participate in public discourse. Efforts in recent years by public-minded young teachers lead to increased levels of public participation among high school students, interviews show. Relative to the low level of  participation at student dissenter clubs in universities, civil society organizers have pointed out the higher level of public participation among high school students, due to the general education offered at school, rather than the more specialized education for college students. Issues with local characteristics can be particularly effective in connecting with high school students who are more connected locally.</span></p><p class=\"c11\"><span class=\"c6\">Nevertheless, teachers who implement information literacy classes or public discussions are in need of additional training for professional knowledge and skills that differ from pedagogy. Furthermore, institutional support from schools is much needed in order to help teachers in overcoming the habit of no politics on campus.</span></p><h3 class=\"c11 c17\" id=\"h.573kx833it3p\"><span class=\"c0\">6. Trust is key: Maintaining trust relation, increasing emotional communication, appealing to common experience, identifying common interest help to establish connection, and reduce confrontation. Methods and processes of information literacy based on trust facilitate good public discourse.</span></h3><h3 class=\"c11 c17 c36\" id=\"h.v4v7bsmmsj4\"></h3><p class=\"c11\"><span class=\"c6\">Trust relations between individuals facilitate both expression of oneself and understanding of others, and are keys for our opinions to be considered and conversations to begin, said interview participants. Furthermore, appealing to common experience and identifying common interest helps to mitigate tension and reduce the opportunity of escalated confrontation between people with different political stances. Identifying common grounds before clarifying differences could increase opportunity for good public discourse.</span></p><p class=\"c11\"><span>When advocating for democracy in Hongkong, some civil society groups would prompt audience interest with Hongkong movies, dim sum, and other popular culture, before making connections to the current state of </span><span>Hongkong’s</span><span class=\"c6\"> society and its various social issues, said interview participants. Given initial results of this approach, interview participants have further recommended that activists should connect social issues with the everyday experience of the audience through concrete scenarios, in order to trigger thinking and conversations.</span></p><p class=\"c11\"><span class=\"c6\">Conversations and consensus based on trust relations are not always based on trustworthy information. Interview participants have also mentioned various difficulties when introducing fact-checking into conversations with family and friends. Therefore, introducing the methods and processes of information literacy rather than the results of fact-checking, could be more effective in facilitating good public discourse.</span></p><div class=\"separator\"></div><div class=\"stickers\"></div><h2 class=\"c11 c17\" id=\"section-7\"><span class=\"c27\">R.

class=\"c27\">Conclusion</span></h2><p class=\"c11\"><span class=\"c6\">This research program establishes the negative impact of information manipulation via literature review, academic consultations, and focus group discussions, which includes the following:</span></p><ol class=\"list-paragraphs\" start=\"1\"><li class=\"c2 li-bullet-0\"><span>Alter public perception, obstruct reasonable public discourse </span></li><li class=\"c2 li-bullet-0\"><span class=\"c6\">Exacerbate confrontation, polarization, damage trust in the society</span></li><li class=\"c2 li-bullet-0\"><span class=\"c6\">Manipulate decision-making of politicians and political parties</span></li><li class=\"c2 li-bullet-0\"><span class=\"c6\">Manipulate result of elections and referendums</span></li></ol><p class=\"c11\"><span class=\"c6\">This research program then lists 5 factors indirectly influencing Taiwan’s election and referendum results, 5 challenges facing public discourse in Taiwan, and 6 opportunities in strengthening Taiwan’s information environment. Lastly, this research program proposes 52 action and policy recommendations to 9 sectors of Taiwan’s society in order to reduce information manipulation, improve public discourse, and strengthen Taiwan’s information environment.</span></p><p class=\"c11\"><span class=\"c6\">The issue of information manipulation has received wide attention from various sectors of Taiwan’s society since 2018. Nevertheless, gaps and differences remain. Consensus exists in the existence of information manipulation and lacks in the harm and the appropriate responses towards such phenomenon. Those who believe that information manipulation is severe might believe that government regulation and civil society responses are slow and weak, while those who believe otherwise might believe that government and civil society actions lack both urgency and legitimacy, therefore question their motivation.</span></p><p class=\"c11\"><span>The issue of information manipulation in Taiwan while being associated with freedom of expression and international relations is also connected to one’s partisan and personal identity. As a policy issue, the public discourse surrounding the issue of information manipulation faces similar challenges described in previous sections. In terms of reducing information manipulation, related public discourse is easily reduced to simplified pairing of certain actions with certain political stances or partisan preference, obstructing reasonable and substantive discussions. Additionally, terms such as “cyber army” (網軍), “information warfare” (資訊戰), and “cognitive warfare” (認知作戰) are being abused and used to attack those who hold different opinions. Ambiguity in the definition of these terms as well as a common lack of evidence or rigorous research when public figures address these topics are leading to more </span><span>confrontation</span><span class=\"c6\">, damaging public trust in related fields, and weakening the resilience of our democracy.</span></p><p class=\"c11\"><span class=\"c6\">The power of a democracy comes from its citizens and at the core of a democracy’s resilience is an informed citizenry. Public participation in politics is a strength and not a weakness of democracy. More participation grounded in credible information formulating public policy via a diverse range of channels can increase political efficacy, create a sense of ownership, and therefore strengthen democratic resilience. When it comes to the issue of information manipulation, everyone is a stakeholder. With greatly increased accessibility to information, information manipulation has a direct reach to all of us, affecting the everyday lives of every one of us living in this age of information. Therefore, the identification of problematic content, behavior, and mechanisms grounded on credible information at the individual level, and the formulation of community consensus and new societal norms through civic participation are essential processes in our self-correction as a democratic society. In these bottom-up processes, institutions must play a role in providing credible information and facilitating participation and consensus-building. Taiwan’s democracy now faces challenges from both outside and from within. We must form a rough consensus on strengthening democratic resilience and continue to connect and collaborate, realizing the strength of Taiwan’s free and vibrant civil society. That is our best way forward for a more perfect union.</span></p><div class=\"separator\"></div><div class=\"stickers\"></div><h2 class=\"c11 c17\" id=\"section-12\"><span class=\"c27\">Acknowledgment</span></h2><p class=\"c11\"><span class=\"c6\">IORG thanks the following researchers, as well as other researchers who wish to remain anonymous for their valuable contributions to this Policy Brief.</span></p><ul class=\"\"><li class=\"\"><span class=\"c6\">Dr. Austin Wang</span></li><li class=\"\"><span class=\"c6\">Dr. Tony Ming-Hung Wang</span></li><li class=\"\"><span class=\"c6\">Dr. Thung-Hong Lin</span></li><li class=\"\"><span class=\"c6\">Dr. Chun-Ming Lai</span></li><li class=\"\"><span class=\"c6\">Dr. Jia-Wei Liu</span></li></ul><div></div>",
