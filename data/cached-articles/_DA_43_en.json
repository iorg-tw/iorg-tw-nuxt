Similar trends between Taiwanese social media and PRC state media on Douyin could be a signal of </span><span>PRC</span><span class=\"c3\"> amplification of the incident.</span></li><li class=\"\"><span class=\"c3\">TDL peaks at the document forgery announcement by Prosecution in September was 31-48% compared with TDL peaks in July.</span></li><li class=\"\"><span>Since 2019, PRC has amplified Russian, Iranian governmental and military sources to accuse the US and its allies of building labs for development, or usage of bio-weapons in many parts of the world. Such narratives can be categorized as Collusion or Chaos narratives of US Skepticism.

Taiwan’s UDN has shown similar behavior in amplifying Russian state media in December 2021, which would justify Russia’s invasion.</span></li><li class=\"\"><span class=\"c3\">Within one month after Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, PRC governmental and state media repeatedly amplified Russian governmental and military sources and accused the US and Ukraine for developing bio-weapons in justification of Russia’s aggression.</span></li><li class=\"\"><span class=\"c3\">Since 2020, conspiracy theories about US making bio-weapons “targeting specific races”, “targeting Chinese people”, “targeting Russian (Slavic) people” have circulated in Mandarin IE, implicating COVID-19 viruses, vaccines, and Taiwan’s Precision Medicine Initiative, hosted at Academia Sinica. Such narratives are appealing to fear, escalating conflict, and legitimizing Russia’s invasion against Ukraine, and PRC’s annexation of Taiwan.</span></li><li class=\"\"><span class=\"c3\">PRC governmental agencies or state media could spread conspiracy theories linking future major public health events (coronavirus, Mpox, wartime epidemics, etc.) to US bio-labs and bio-weapons.
