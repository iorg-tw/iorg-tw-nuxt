The issue of ractopamine pork and the 4th nuclear power plant took turns in lead.</span></li><li class=\"c2 c8 li-bullet-0\"><span class=\"c0\">Based on our analyses of issue liveliness and content inclination, the CCP paid most attention to ractopamine pork throughout our data source period.</span></li><li class=\"c2 c8 li-bullet-0\"><span class=\"c0\">The correlation of referendum content between CCP outlets and Taiwanese information space decreased: IORG thinks as the referendum day gets close, the liveliness of referendum questions in Taiwan’s information space becomes more equal. At the same time, CCP outlets continued to focus on the issue of ractopamine pork, which resulted in a decrease of their referendum content correlation.</span></li><li class=\"c2 c8 li-bullet-0\"><span class=\"c0\">After political mobilization, the discussion of referendums on Facebook became more slogan-based. Issue-pairing analyses show that inclination towards the question of the 4th nuclear power plant has decreased over the past 3 weeks.</span></li><li class=\"c2 c8 li-bullet-0\"><span class=\"c0\">Over the past 3 weeks, though 4-disagree facebook posts still outnumbered 4-agree posts, their combined user reactions became less than those of 4-agree posts. 4-agree posts remain better performed in terms of average user reaction.</span></li><li class=\"c2 c8 li-bullet-0\"><span class=\"c0\">“4-agree” and “4-disagree” fight in a showdown over ractopamine pork: Before, the question of the 4th nuclear power plant appeared more often in DPP’s “4-disagree” facebook posts. Yet the question of ractopamine pork has taken over in the past 3 weeks. As for the KMT, the referendum question that appears most frequently in their “4-agree” posts has always been ractopamine pork.</span></li><li class=\"c2 c8 li-bullet-0\"><span class=\"c0\">Over 40% of CCP outlet’s content regarding Taiwan’s referendum come from Taiwanese media. The 3 most cited Taiwanese media are Want Want China Times (旺中), udn (聯合) and CNA (中央社), in which WWCT was cited once every 4 reports. This might imply that the news content of WWCT is more in line with the official position of the CCP regarding Taiwan’s referendum, resulting in a higher percentage of citation.</span></li><li class=\"c2 c8 li-bullet-0\"><span>The DPP and the KMT are the most mentioned Taiwanese organizations in CCP outlet’s referendum-related reports. But as the referendum date approaches, the percentage of words that attack the ruling DPP party also increased, such as “the green camp’s cyber army” or “</span><span>Eastern Depot (東廠)</span><span>”. This might be the CCP’s propaganda tactic to indirectly influence the public opinion in Taiwan regarding the referendum.</span></li></ul><div class=\"separator\"></div><p class=\"c2\"><span>Full version of this Dokidoki Alert is available in Taiwanese Mandarin.
