A narrative can be qualified as unreasonable or manipulative through IORG’s </span><span class=\"c4\"><a class=\"c17\" href=\"https://iorg.tw/eval\">information credibility evaluation</a></span><span class=\"c2\"> process.</span></p><p class=\"c3\"><span class=\"c2\">Taiwan-US relations have always been an important issue in Taiwan. As bilateral relations have grown stronger in recent years, various narratives have been spreading in Taiwan’s information environment, fostering skepticism towards the US. This phenomenon has prompted much public interest. However, public discourse has been based on more commentary than research, highlighting a gap in which this report aims to fill.</span></p><p class=\"c3\"><span>In 2018, Kuang-Shun Yang, co-founder of US-Taiwan Watch, introduced the phrase “US Skepticism” in Mandarin (疑美論), and characterized it as “a mainstream opinion in Taiwan” in his article titled “</span><span class=\"c4\"><a class=\"c17\" href=\"https://medium.com/@kuangshnyng/2cfebdf7494d\">Protecting Taiwan is US National Interest</a></span><span>.” In </span><span>2021</span><span>, Fang-Yu Chen, an Political Science scholar, mentioned four narratives that connect Taiwan-US partnership to the provocation of the People’s Republic of China (PRC) in a book titled “</span><span class=\"c4\"><a class=\"c17\" href=\"https://www.linkingbooks.com.tw/LNB/book/Book.aspx?ID=161405\">Why and How the US Matters</a></span><span>.” After US troops withdrew from Afghanistan in August 2021, </span><span class=\"c4\"><a class=\"c17\" href=\"https://iorg.tw/da/11\">IORG</a></span><span class=\"c2\"> identified eleven US Skepticism narratives circulating in Taiwan’s information environment. These narratives claimed that the US will abandon Taiwan, the US is not strong enough to protect Taiwan, and the US is the source of chaos and war in the world. These three precedents lay the foundations of the definition of “US Skepticism” in this report.</span></p><p class=\"c3\"><span class=\"c2\">Given the growing importance of Taiwan in international affairs, it is essential to continue to identify, categorize, and attribute unreasonable and manipulative narratives regarding Taiwan-US relations. This report employs a data science approach to document “US Skepticism” in the Mandarin information environment, providing data evidence for each of the narratives, and a framework for content and behavioral analysis for the subject. This report aims to contribute to the on-going national and global effort in reducing the harm of information manipulation and creating favorable conditions for reasonable and constructive democratic discourse.</span></p><div class=\"separator\"></div><div class=\"gdoc-photo-container\"><div class=\"images\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/md1VSiCaWjaUIeknvs4ydFUo9w-mahfJuizkGET0l_Syg_9GmpHHx5KFol1PBcWzH3bTWSm3AeMBw0Bk3MoriaNJy_3vClMqszZ6rqjeUCtHZSlbFsM3cy7rrzUMz49gMHisCHZnf32p-oUU\" title=\"\"></div></div><div class=\"separator\"></div><div class=\"stickers\"></div><h2 class=\"c7\" id=\"h2-2\"><span class=\"c23\">Escalating Narratives – From Unfair Exchange to Hollowing Out, from Abandonment to Destruction</span></h2><p class=\"c3\"><span class=\"c2\">This report has selected twelve key events during the years 2021-2023 and has identified eighty-four narratives that are both thematically related to the events and can be categorized as US Skepticism according to the aforementioned definition. The narratives have been identified through human-AI collaboration based on IORG’s Information Environment Archive and Directory. According to its content, each narrative is then grouped into one of eight types of US Skepticism.</span></p><p class=\"c3\"><span>Collectively, these eighty-four narratives present an escalation in the harmfulness of both US actions towards Taiwan and its end goal for Taiwan. According to these narratives, US actions towards Taiwan have progressed from conducting </span><span class=\"c24\">unfair exchanges</span><span> with Taiwan to </span><span class=\"c24\">hollowing out</span><span> Taiwan. The end goal, as the change of narratives implies, has also shifted from the US </span><span class=\"c24\">abandonment</span><span> of Taiwan to the </span><span class=\"c24\">destruction</span><span class=\"c2\"> of Taiwan altogether.</span></p><div class=\"gdoc-table-container\"><div class=\"table\"><table class=\"c19\"><tbody><tr class=\"c13\"><th class=\"\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"></th><th

As </span><span class=\"c4\"><a class=\"c17\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/AIT.Social.Media/photos/a.10152622747243490/10159196570608490/\">news</a></span><span> emerged that Taiwan was to receive the first batch of Moderna vaccines, the narrative of Taiwan </span><span>“using arms </span><span>purchases and microchips in exchange for US vaccines</span><span>” circulated widely</span><span>. In August, when the Biden Administration </span><span class=\"c4\"><a class=\"c17\" href=\"https://www.cna.com.tw/news/firstnews/202108050010.aspx\">confirmed</a></span><span class=\"c2\"> its first arms sale to Taiwan, narratives appeared to accuse that the weapons were “scrap metal” and “overpriced.” Later in the same month, the US withdrawal from Afghanistan was used as evidence to support narratives asserting that the US “will abandon Taiwan”. Ractopamine pork ban was the most discussed topic among Taiwan’s four national referenda held in November 2021. Narratives regarding unfair exchanges were revised into “buying (toxic) pork in exchange for vaccines”, reinforcing the notion of Taiwan-US relations as a series of transactions in which the Taiwanese interest was neglected, and that the people of Taiwan were sacrificed and abandoned.</span></p><p class=\"c3\"><span>In 2022 (event 5-9), </span><span class=\"c24\">hollowing out</span><span> and </span><span class=\"c24\">destruction</span><span> were the highlights of US Skepticism, constituting an effective “upgrade” from last year. Russia’s full-scale invasion against Ukraine in February marked an increase of baseline amount of content regarding conflict in Taiwan’s information environment. Narratives appeared attributing the war to US-NATO provocation or US-trained Ukrainian “Nazi,” emphasizing that the US is the source of chaos, bringing about war and destruction in and around the world. In May, President Joe Biden </span><span class=\"c4\"><a class=\"c17\" href=\"https://www.cna.com.tw/news/aopl/202205230324.aspx\">announced</a></span><span> the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF), marking the first appearance of a Destruction narrative (Type H) in this report, asserting that the inclusion of Taiwan in IPEF is equivalent to the US “making Taiwan a battlefield.” Speaker Pelosi visiting Taiwan in August brought about an array of war-related narratives while PRC military exercises took place around Taiwan. Late October, news of </span><span class=\"c4\"><a class=\"c17\" href=\"https://focustaiwan.tw/business/202211010012\">the tool-in ceremony</a></span><span class=\"c2\"> of the new TSMC Arizona plant was a good opportunity for narratives to accuse the US of “hollowing out” Taiwan, extracting the valuable resources and people, and making preparations to destroy Taiwan. Finally, narratives surrounding the potential visit of Speaker Kevin McCarthy once again reinforced the image of a warmongering US and the “Ukrainianization” of Taiwan. The destruction theme continued in the first half of 2023 (event 10-12), around President Tsai’s US transit in April, as well as the five shortages of electricity, eggs, water, medicine, and meat.</span></p><p class=\"c3\"><span class=\"c2\">Escalation among US Skepticism narratives can be a signal of increased public concern in Taiwan-US relations due to the Russian invasion against Ukraine and PRC military exercises around Taiwan. It can also be a signal of increased domestic political interest and foreign influence in creating unreasonable and manipulative narratives, or amplifying such narratives with various inauthentic, coordinated, and manipulative means to further discredit Taiwan-US relations and connect such alliance to war.</span></p><p class=\"c3\"><span class=\"c2\">Further actor categorization is necessary to distinguish between domestic (Taiwanese) and foreign actors, as well as between state and private actors. Actors can be categorized with credible and publicly-verifiable information in IORG’s Information Environment Directory. Three types of actors are relevant in this report. PRC actors are actors controlled by PRC state authorities, state media, or state-affiliated media organizations. Chinese actors are actors controlled by Chinese nationals, private organizations, or unspecified entities that are likely to be Chinese. Taiwanese actors are actors controlled by Taiwan nationals, private organizations, public-funded organizations, or unspecified entities that are likely to be Taiwanese.</span></p><p class=\"c3\"><span class=\"c2\">From a data science perspective, a narrative can be defined as a set of documents (news articles, social media posts, instant messages, etc.), each published by an author (individual, organization, anonymous account, etc.) at a specific platform and time. This set of documents forms the narrative’s main argument, its life cycle in the information environment, and its network behavior characteristics consist of actors across physical and cyber localities. The Information Environment Archive and Directory and human-AI collaborative processes at IORG provides this report with data evidence necessary for further analysis in terms of actor involvement in the creation and amplification of US Skepticism narratives.</span></p><div class=\"separator\"></div><div class=\"stickers\"></div><h2 class=\"c7\" id=\"h2-3\"><span class=\"c23\">Continued PRC Involvement Signifies Tactics and Priorities</span></h2><p class=\"c3\"><span>Overall, PRC is the largest source of foreign influence in terms of both creation and amplification of US Skepticism narratives. Furthermore, PRC involvement in narrative amplification is </span><span class=\"c24\">high</span><span> while the involvement in narrative creation is </span><span class=\"c24\">low</span><span class=\"c2\">. In other words, PRC actors tend to “join in” and spread existing specific narratives of US Skepticism rather than creating new ones. Data shows that PRC actors have been involved in the amplification of seventy US Skepticism narratives while creating twenty-eight narratives, out of the total eighty-four.</span></p><div class=\"gdoc-photo-container\"><div class=\"images\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/G-mtjp6JDRp09dPSH0Bp0FLAT6NVMOuTr3_S5c8WSnWY88J2wSMcLldye9EJMDRXWREPKqdr2IVzltH74O2UvQ1WsNVB4jhiVwNR9t5x94LIezyjN7oygcKF7n8L9_U_9e_BVpCvP0vTsG9V\" title=\"\"></div><p class=\"description\"><span class=\"c2\">Figure 1 – Amplification of 8 types of 84 US Skepticism narratives related to 12 key events during 2021-June 2023, showing high level of PRC involvement.

Sixteen Type E (Collusion) narratives and fifteen Type D (Fake Friend) narratives have been amplified by PRC actors, the two most out of all types. Furthermore, both types have eight narratives which were created by PRC actors, also surpassing other types. This shows a collective tendency among PRC actors which could be the result of both a top-down strategic decision based on PRC internal logic, or that of a collective trial-and-error process among the actors. Both indicate that the anthropomorphization of foreign affairs and the idea that the US will betray Taiwan for its self-interest is capable of maximizing damage to Taiwan-US relations.</span></p><p class=\"c3\"><span class=\"c2\">Third-party actor narrative creation indicates that Chaos narratives are too aggressive to be directly created by PRC actors, but proxies or volunteers instead. Five Type C (Chaos) narratives were created by non-Taiwan and non-PRC actors, the most out of all types. Among five narratives, two (26 40) were created by “He-Tan” (和坛), two (35 37) by Russian state media Sputnik and RT, and one (34) by “Global Chinese Military Alliance” (全球華人軍事聯盟). “He-Tan” is a Facebook Page controlled by China VTV (中華微視), a Hong Kong-based Chinese-language media group; Russian state media is in an official cooperation relationship with PRC state media; “Global Chinese Military Alliance” is an anonymous Facebook Page part of a Malaysia-based content farm group.</span></p><p class=\"c3\"><span>Lack of PRC involvement in certain narratives suggests PRC strategic goals that supersedes the goal of weakening Taiwan-US relations, including </span><span class=\"c24\">vaccine supremacy</span><span>, </span><span class=\"c24\">Taiwan’s provincial status</span><span>, and </span><span class=\"c24\">PRC’s peaceful image</span><span class=\"c2\">. Fourteen out of the total eighty-four narratives were lacking any PRC involvement. Two narratives (3 5) mentioned Taiwan’s domestic vaccine development, contradicting the supposed PRC vaccine supremacy. Two narratives (40 41) were related to Taiwan’s sovereignty, contradicting the PRC claim that Taiwan is part of China. Eight narratives (23 26 31 39 68 71 79 80) referenced a Taiwan Strait war or a world war, implying that the PRC is an aggressor and damaging the self-promoted peaceful image. However, recent PRC involvement in creating and amplifying war-related narratives around Speaker Pelosi’s Taiwan visit (August 2022) and the Tsai-McCarthy meeting (April 2023) also showed periodic deprioritization of this peaceful image and promotion of PRC military might over Taiwan.</span></p><div class=\"separator\"></div><div class=\"stickers\"></div><h2 class=\"c7\" id=\"h2-4\"><span>Narratives from Within Taiwan Reflect Collective Psychology</span></h2><p class=\"c3\"><span class=\"c2\">Forty-four out of the total eighty-four narratives have been recognized to be created by Taiwanese actors. These include, in descending order, twelve Type E (Collusion), ten Type C (Chaos) narratives, and nine Type A (Abandonment). This report argues that the creation of these narratives indicate existing collective psychology in Taiwanese society. These collective psychological attributes contribute to the continued circulation of the unreasonable and manipulative US Skepticism narratives in Taiwanese society. They can also be conceptualized as the “cracks” in Taiwanese society, which draws the creators of US Skepticism to produce matching narratives to deepen such divide. </span></p><p class=\"c3\"><span>Creation of Type E (Collusion) narratives within Taiwan reflect the partisan polarization in Taiwanese society. Out of the eleven Collusion narratives, seven were created by politicians and anonymous Facebook pages in opposition, two were created by a media outlet and an affiliated web programming under Want-Want China Group. Despite containing outrageous claims and pseudo-conspiracies, Collusion narratives still circulate Taiwan’s information environment, indicating affective decision-making.

This awareness recognizes that the US is capable of effectively influencing world affairs regardless of being favorable or oppositional to US actions. Explicit mention of war in all Chaos narratives indicates the on-going anxiety of conflict among the Taiwanese public. </span><span class=\"c4\"><a class=\"c17\" href=\"https://indsr.org.tw/focus?typeid=38&amp;uid=7&amp;pid=13\">A March 2022 poll</a></span><span> showed that 41.0</span><span>%</span><span> </span><span class=\"c2\">of Taiwanese people lack confidence in the capability of Taiwan’s military defending Taiwan, and that 49.2% do not think that the US military will assist in Taiwan’s self-defense.

This report further argues from a grassroots point-of-view that the orphan mentality is rooted in Taiwan’s four-hundred-year colonial history. One of the most important work in Taiwanese literature is “Orphan of Asia” (亞細亞的孤兒) by Wu Chuo-Liu (吳濁流). It was first published in 1946, expressing the perplexity of the Taiwanese identity at the end of WWII and the Japanese rule over Taiwan. In July 2022, Japanese ambassador Izumi Hiroyasu (泉裕泰) mentioned during a public event that the late Prime Minister Abe Shinzo once reminded him to “not let [the Taiwanese people] feel lonely” before his assignment to Taiwan, indicating an awareness of the potential political consequences of the Abandonment sentiment among Taiwanese public.

While information literacy capacity remains vital for individual actors to discern credible content, recognizing societal attributes that incentivizes creation or amplification of controversial content provides valuable access points for intervention. Advocacy or policies can be prescribed to ease partisanship or reduce orphan mentality, making irresponsible personal actions less favorable, and effectively creating space for information literacy to properly operate.</span></p><p class=\"c3\"><span>Additionally, the acknowledgement of collective psychology as a factor in the information transference process modifies the informational network model from a network of individuals to a network of micro-communities. This updated model suggests that individuals are affected by the collective psychology of their micro-community. Therefore, the responsibility for a better information environment can be understood as not only an individual responsibility but a communal one. This provides a conceptual ground for efforts of community trust-building in addition to individual capacity-building. Collaborative communities such as </span><span class=\"c4\"><a class=\"c17\" href=\"https://g0v.tw/\">g0v.tw</a></span><span class=\"c2\"> provide inspiration for building trustable environments and trustworthy personal connections. Information sharing, authentic communications, and physical gatherings are some of the essential components in creating communities of trust. These communities of trust would serve as the middle layer in between individual and institution, providing an extra layer of support for vulnerable individuals, and contributing to the essential collective task of strengthening democratic resilience.</span></p><div class=\"separator\"></div><div class=\"stickers\"></div><h2 class=\"c7\" id=\"h2-5\"><span class=\"c23\">US Skepticism Reverberates PRC Propaganda and Completes PRC’s Worldview</span></h2><p class=\"c3\"><span class=\"c2\">Among the eight types of US Skepticism, four (A D E H) refer to Taiwan-US relations while the other four (B C F G) address the US alone.</span></p><p class=\"c3\"><span class=\"c2\">Type A and D frame Taiwan-US relations as a “fake friendship” in that the US will abandon Taiwan.

To emphasize the supposed bond between the people of China and Taiwan, PRC official statements and state media reports often use phrases such as “two shores one dear family” (两岸一家亲), “blood thicker than water” (血浓于水), “same root same origin” (同根同源), and “same language same ethnicity” (同文同种). </span></p><div class=\"gdoc-table-container\"><div class=\"table\"><table class=\"c19\"><tbody><tr class=\"c13\"><th class=\"\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p>Commonly-Used Phrase </p></th><th class=\"\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p>English Translation</p></th><th class=\"\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p># Documents 2023.1-6</p></th></tr><tr class=\"c13\"><td class=\"\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p>两岸一家亲</p></td><td class=\"\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p>two shores one dear family</p></td><td class=\"number\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p>4,807</p></td></tr><tr class=\"c13\"><td class=\"\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p>血浓于水</p></td><td class=\"\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p>blood thicker than water</p></td><td class=\"number\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p>1,986</p></td></tr><tr class=\"c13\"><td class=\"\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p>同根同源</p></td><td class=\"\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p>same root same origin</p></td><td class=\"number\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p>1,541</p></td></tr><tr class=\"c13\"><td class=\"\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p>同文同种</p></td><td class=\"\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p>same language same ethnicity</p></td><td class=\"number\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p>1,080</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p class=\"c3 c29 description\" id=\"h.g1mqdsbykge1\"><span class=\"c1\">Table 4 – Number of documents mentioning the commonly-used phrases in the Mandarin information environment during Jan-Jun 2023.</span></p></div><p class=\"c3\"><span>During Taiwan’s COVID-19 vaccine shortage in mid-2021, PRC official statements repeatedly emphasized that Taiwanese people were receiving help from China.

Furthermore, PRC propaganda describes the government as self-willed (一意孤行) and perverse (倒行逆施), neglecting people’s livelihoods (罔顾民生) and voices (漠视民意), and selling out the people of Taiwan for its own benefit. In this version of the world, the current government in Taiwan is not a government of the people, but a tyrannical self-serving ruling elite, and is therefore more than capable of collusion with the US and destroying Taiwan.</span></p><div class=\"gdoc-table-container\"><div class=\"table\"><table class=\"c19\"><tbody><tr class=\"c13\"><th class=\"\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p>Commonly-Used Phrase </p></th><th class=\"\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p>English Translation</p></th><th class=\"\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p># Documents 2023.1-6</p></th></tr><tr class=\"c13\"><td class=\"\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p>民进党当局</p></td><td class=\"\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p>DPP authorities</p></td><td class=\"number\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p>10,581</p></td></tr><tr class=\"c13\"><td class=\"\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p>勾连</p></td><td class=\"\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p>conspiring</p></td><td class=\"number\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p>4,492</p></td></tr><tr class=\"c13\"><td class=\"\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p>谋独</p></td><td class=\"\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p>plotting for independence</p></td><td class=\"number\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p>3,786</p></td></tr><tr class=\"c13\"><td class=\"\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p>一意孤行</p></td><td class=\"\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p>self-willed</p></td><td class=\"number\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p>2,836</p></td></tr><tr class=\"c13\"><td class=\"\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p>倒行逆施</p></td><td class=\"\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p>perverse</p></td><td class=\"number\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p>831</p></td></tr><tr class=\"c13\"><td class=\"\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p>罔顾民生</p></td><td class=\"\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p>neglecting people’s livelihoods</p></td><td class=\"number\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p>108</p></td></tr><tr class=\"c13\"><td class=\"\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p>漠视民意</p></td><td class=\"\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p>neglecting people’s voices</p></td><td class=\"number\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p>146</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p class=\"c3 c29 description\" id=\"h.ajdqb51freln\"><span class=\"c1\">Table 5 – Number of documents mentioning the commonly-used phrases in the Mandarin information environment during Jan-Jun 2023.</span></p></div><p class=\"c3\"><span class=\"c2\">Type B and F claim that the US is internally weak and non-democratic.

Together, these Mandarin narratives describe a US detrimental to the world, present the PRC in a positive light as a superior alternative, and construct an alternative worldview that compels its readers to partake in the “great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation” (中华民族伟大复兴). For the people of Taiwan and the Mandarin-speaking diasporas around the world, this worldview can be attractive in various degrees. Adoption of this worldview could lead to changes in political behaviors, constituting a feasible pathway for information manipulation to affect election results and damage election integrity.</span></p><div class=\"separator\"></div><div class=\"stickers\"></div><h2 class=\"c7\" id=\"h2-6\"><span class=\"c23\">Conclusion</span></h2><p class=\"c3\"><span class=\"c2\">This report has compiled eighty-four “US Skepticism” narratives related to twelve key events during the years 2021-2023. It provides data evidence of continued circulation of these eighty-four unreasonable and manipulative narratives in the Mandarin information environment that may discredit Taiwan-US relations. Analysis on narrative content and behavioral data has further concluded the level of involvement among PRC and Taiwanese actors in the creation and amplification of US Skepticism narratives. It also provides additional signals to both the priorities of the PRC state and the collective psychology of the Taiwanese public. Finally, a mapping of US Skepticism and other PRC propaganda illustrates an alternative worldview to which Mandarin speakers could be susceptible.</span></p><p class=\"c3\"><span class=\"c2\">US Skepticism manufactures negative images of Taiwan’s democratic allies and Taiwan’s democratic governance. These unreasonable and manipulative narratives are harmful to the quality of public discourse, create unfounded mistrust towards democracy, and therefore should be rejected. Readers should also take note of actors that repeatedly create or amplify these narratives, and should exercise substantiated skepticism towards these actors. While US Skepticism should be rejected, sound arguments on the subject should be respected and welcomed. Like any other topic in public affairs, Taiwan’s foreign policies are and should be subjected to public scrutiny and debate. To ensure a well-functioning public discourse on the matter, it is essential to make careful distinctions between US Skepticism and reasonable skepticism towards the US with fact-checking and information credibility credibility.</span></p><p class=\"c3\"><span class=\"c2\">Responses to US Skepticism involve various actors operating with the rough consensus that reasonable public discourse is fundamental for a functioning democracy. Here are four responses: information accessibility, information literacy, strategic communications, and multidisciplinary research. </span></p><p class=\"c3\"><span>First, information accessibility should be enhanced by governments, institutions, and professionals on Taiwan-US relations and international affairs. Accessible and credible information on the subject is essential to establishing constructive public discourse and enabling better individual and institutional decision-making around Taiwan-US relations and Taiwan’s foreign policies. </span><span class=\"c4\"><a class=\"c17\" href=\"https://ustw.watch\">US-Taiwan Watch</a></span><span class=\"c2\"> is a good example of the popularization of expertise on the subject.</span></p><p class=\"c3\"><span>Second, information literacy capacity should be enhanced at both the individual and community level. Since 2021, </span><span class=\"c4\"><a class=\"c17\" href=\"https://iorg.tw\">IORG</a></span><span> and </span><span class=\"c4\"><a class=\"c17\" href=\"https://pangphuann.tw/\">Taiwan Pàng-phuānn Association of Education</a></span><span class=\"c2\"> have been hosting workshops in every county and city of Taiwan since 2021. Participants include teachers and students in middle and high schools, as well as parents and senior citizens in local communities. During these workshops, participants can engage with real-life examples, practice fact-checking, and identify manipulation with IORG’s information credibility evaluation. Group sessions during these workshops also allowed the participants to engage with each other face-to-face, compare evaluation results, and establish the basis for trust.</span></p><p class=\"c3\"><span class=\"c2\">Third, public communications in refuting US Skepticism should be strategic in being inclusive and practical. Given the complex composition of individual intent to participate in US Skepticism, public-oriented content on Taiwan-US relations should be inclusive to those who are in doubt, avoiding further alienation. It should provide facts and clarify falsehoods while being aware of the risk of emotional responses that could conversely consolidate unfavorable individual and environmental attributes and further US Skepticism. Moreover, public communications should be practical towards uncertainties in Taiwan-US relations. Content that expresses and clarifies uncertainty allows its audiences to familiarize with uncertainty, which could lead to increased tolerance, sustained support for democracy, and better decision-making when faced with skepticism.</span></p><p class=\"c3\"><span class=\"c2\">Fourth, data science and other multidisciplinary research should continue to better understand various aspects of US Skepticism, including the social and informational environments in which such narratives arise and circulate. Rigorous scientific research produces credible information that could then be made accessible via the first response. Additionally, collaborative research between the scientific community and civil society builds trustable partnerships, which are essential for the whole-of-society response to information manipulation and authoritarian expansion. This year, in collaboration with academics in computer science, social science, and neuroscience, IORG is conducting multiple public opinion polls to survey video social media consumption in Taiwan, as well as behavioral experiments to better understand the relationship between information manipulation and public support for democracy. </span></p><p class=\"c3\"><span>As the next Taiwanese Presidential election in January 2024 approaches, public discourse is turning its focus onto the candidates. As foreign policy is an important area for debate, discourse related to the US (as well as Taiwan’s other allies) is expected to continue, including unreasonable or manipulative narratives. US Skepticism narratives under the Presidential election context is likely to include more Fake Friend and Collusion narratives, prioritizing the discrediting of the government and its officials for their Taiwan-US policies. The “Nan-Hai Meeting” incident is a good example. On July 12</span><span class=\"c22\">th</span><span>, reports published by </span><span class=\"c4\"><a class=\"c17\" href=\"https://udn.com/news/story/6656/7294140\">United Daily News</a></span><span class=\"c2\"> (UDN) used photographs of alleged Taiwanese governmental meeting minutes to claim that the US “demanded Taiwan to set up a P4 lab” to “develop bio weapons.” Taiwan’s government has since refuted this claim. The alleged “US demand” (美方要求) can be interpreted as US coercion, supporting Fake Friend narratives. The alleged language of President Tsai’s “paying great attention” (非常重視) to the matter and her “directive” (指示) to comply can be interpreted as US-Taiwan collusion, supporting Collusion narratives. The fact that this specific incident featured official documents, former Premier Su as the alleged meeting chair, and President Tsai’s expressing approval demonstrated the special characteristics of US Skepticism during election campaigns in Taiwan. Continued monitoring and analysis is critical in safeguarding election integrity in Taiwan from information manipulation, as well as the continued strengthening of the partnerships among democratic countries.</span></p><p class=\"c3\"><span class=\"c2\">Lastly, the analytical components and methodology utilized in this report can be reproduced to conduct research on US Skepticism in other information environments, as well as research on manipulative narratives targeting other countries.
