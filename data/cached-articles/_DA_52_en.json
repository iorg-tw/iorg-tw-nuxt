Israel-Palestine conflict average TDL among PRC governmental agencies and state media is 23% of that of the Russia-Ukraine war, while TDL peak of the former is 17% of the latter.</span></li><li class=\"\"><span class=\"c3\">Taiwanese media groups <label class=\"sticker node group\"><span class=\"content\">ETtoday</span></label> <label class=\"sticker node group\"><span class=\"content\">Mirror</span></label> <label class=\"sticker node group\"><span class=\"content\">JFI</span></label> <label class=\"sticker node group\"><span class=\"content\">SET</span></label> <label class=\"sticker node group\"><span class=\"content\">Storm</span></label> have published reports with clickbait such as “naked corpse” (裸屍) , “torture kill” (虐殺), “blood smell” (血腥), and “bloodbath” (血洗), inhibiting reader understanding of the topic while obstructing reasonable public discourse.</span></li><li class=\"\"><span class=\"c3\">Out of the 12 suspicious narratives, 7 can be categorized as US Skepticism, including 4 Chaos, 1 Weakness, 1 Abandonment, and 1 Fake friend narrative.</span></li><li class=\"\"><span class=\"c3\">3 narratives concern Ukraine, including “Hamas weapons came from Ukraine” (3), “Ukraine is abandoned” (5), and “Ukraine admitted to losing weapons” (12), shaping the image of Ukraine as abandoned and corrupted, creating distrust against democratic alliances.</span></li><li class=\"\"><span class=\"c3\">4 narratives concern Taiwan, including “Israel-Palestine conflict makes Taiwan feel the menace of arms and the danger of war” (兵凶戰危) (1), “Taiwanese people receive reply of cold indifference (冷回) from the diplomatic mission when asked for help” (7), “White House military aid is pushing Taiwan towards war” (8), and “White House is only using Taiwan to pass the military aid bill” (9), appealing to the fear of war, shaping the image of Taiwan’s government as unreliable, creating distrust against Taiwan’s democratic governance and democratic allies.</span></li><li class=\"\"><span class=\"c3\">3 narratives originated from non-governmental actors and were amplified by PRC government agencies or state media, including “Hamas weapons came from Ukraine” (3), “US cannot save Israel” (4) and “Ukraine is abandoned” (5).</span></li><li class=\"\"><span>PRC attempts made to shape the image of the US as unreliable and a source of chaos, while portraying itself as a “righteous (王道) peacemaker”, strengthening a worldview in the Mandarin IE in service of PRC interests, and consistent with PRC strategy in “creating disagreement towards the US and agreement towards China” among the international community.
